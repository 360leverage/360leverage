        Thank you for purchasing from 360 Leverage. We strive to provide
        high-quality CV templates and services. By using our Products, you agree
        to the following Cancellation and Refund Policy:
        <br />
        1. Cancellation Policy Once a product has been purchased and the
        download has been initiated, the transaction is considered final. Due to
        the nature of digital products (CV templates), we do not offer
        cancellations for purchases once the download has been completed. If you
        have purchased a product but have not yet downloaded it, you may contact
        us to request assistance. However, once the product has been accessed,
        the sale is considered complete.
        <br />
        2. Refund Policy Digital Products (CV Templates): Due to the instant
        access provided to digital products upon purchase, we do not offer
        refunds once a CV template or other downloadable product has been
        purchased and downloaded. Defective Products: If you encounter any
        technical issues with a template youâ€™ve purchased (e.g., a file is
        corrupt or does not work as described), please contact us at
        letsventure9@gmail.com within 7 days of your purchase, and we will offer
        a solution, such as providing you with a new version of the product or
        helping you resolve any issues.
        <br />
        3. How to Request a Refund or Assistance If you believe you are eligible
        for a refund based on the conditions outlined above, or if you are
        facing technical issues with a product, please contact our support team
        at letsventure9@gmail.com. We will respond to your request within 7
        business days and work to resolve the issue promptly.
        <br />
        4. Exceptions We understand that there may be exceptional circumstances
        in which a customer may be dissatisfied with the product. If you are
        facing issues with a purchase, please contact us directly, and we will
        do our best to assist you. Refunds or exchanges may be considered under
        special circumstances at our discretion.
